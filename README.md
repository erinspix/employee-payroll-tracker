Employee Payroll Tracker
##Project Overview
This project involves creating an employee payroll tracker that allows users to add new employees, input their details, and display sorted employee data with aggregated payroll information.

##Assignment Scope
The task was to build a user interface where users can add employee information, with prompts guiding them through the process. After adding employees, the data is displayed on the page, sorted alphabetically by last name, and relevant payroll data is calculated and displayed in the console.

##Key Features
Add Employee Workflow:
Clicking the "Add Employee" button prompts the user to enter the first name, last name, and salary.
After entering the details, users can choose to continue adding employees or cancel.
Data Display:
Upon canceling, the employee data is displayed on the page, sorted alphabetically by last name.
The console outputs computed and aggregated payroll data.
##What I Learned
JavaScript Prompts: Implemented user input prompts for a seamless data entry process.
Data Sorting: Learned how to sort and display employee data alphabetically by last name.
Aggregation: Gained experience in computing and displaying aggregated payroll data using JavaScript.
User Flow: Improved my understanding of creating user-friendly workflows in web applications.
Conclusion
This employee payroll tracker efficiently handles employee data input, displays it in a user-friendly manner, and provides useful payroll calculations. Future improvements could include adding a feature to edit or delete employee entries and enhancing the user interface.
